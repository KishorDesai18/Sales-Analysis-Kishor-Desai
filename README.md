**Sales Analysis with Power BI Dashboard**  
This project involves creating a comprehensive sales analysis dashboard using a synthetic dataset of 10,000 orders. The dashboard includes 20 key performance indicators (KPIs) to provide actionable insights into revenue trends, customer behavior, product performance, and operational efficiency. The results are saved to a CSV file for further reporting and visualization.

**Dataset Description**  
The dataset simulates 10,000 sales transactions and contains the following columns:  
**Column Name	Description**  
1. OrderID - Unique identifier for each order  
2. CustomerID	- Unique identifier for each customer  
3. ProductID	 - Unique identifier for each product  
4. OrderDate - The date when the order was placed  
5. ShipDate - The date when the order was shipped  
6. Category - Broad category of the product (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Books)  
7. SubCategory - Sub-category of the product (e.g., Smartphones, Laptops, Shirts)  
8. Region	- The region of the customer (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia, South America)  
9. Quantity - Number of units sold 
10. UnitPrice - Price per unit of the product  
11. Discount - Discount applied to the product (in %)  
12. ShippingCost - Cost of shipping  
13. TotalSales - Total revenue generated for the order  
14. Profit - Profit earned after accounting for product cost and shipping  
15. FulfillmentTime - Number of days taken to fulfill the order (calculated as ShipDate - OrderDate)

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
The following steps were applied to clean and preprocess the data:  
1.	Generating Calculated Columns:  
**o	TotalSales: Calculated as Quantity × UnitPrice × (1−Discount/100)  
o	Profit = Total Sales−(Quantity × Unit Price × 0.6 + Shipping Cost)**  
o	Fulfillment Time: Derived as the difference between Ship Date and Order Date in days.  
2.	Handling Missing Values:  
o	Since this dataset is synthetic, no missing values were present.  
3.	Data Types:  
o	Ensured correct data types for dates (datetime), numerical columns (float, int), and categorical columns (object).  
4.	Grouping and Aggregation:  
o	Used pandas groupby functions for calculating KPIs like category revenue distribution, region performance, and customer lifetime value.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  
The KPIs are grouped into basic and advanced categories to provide a comprehensive view of the business.  

**Basic KPIs**  

1.	Total Revenue: The sum of TotalSales across all orders.  
o	Purpose: Measures the total revenue generated by the business.   
2.	Average Order Value (AOV): Total revenue divided by the number of orders.  
o	Purpose: Indicates the average revenue per order.  
3.	Profit Margin: The percentage of revenue retained as profit.  
o	**Formula: (Total Profit/Total Revenue)×100.**  
4.	Top-Performing Product: The product with the highest total sales.  
o	Purpose: Identifies which product drives the most revenue.  
5.	Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): The total revenue contributed by the top customers.  
o	Purpose: Helps identify high-value customers for retention efforts.

**Advanced KPIs**  

7.	Category Revenue Distribution: Percentage of total revenue contributed by each category.   
o	Purpose: Highlights which product categories are most profitable.  
8.	Region Performance: Revenue and profit generated in each region.  
o	Purpose: Identifies regional strengths and weaknesses.  
9.	Discount Effectiveness: Correlation between discounts and the quantity sold.   
o	Purpose: Evaluates the impact of discounts on sales volume.  
10.	Shipping Cost Impact: The percentage of total revenue spent on shipping costs.   
o	Purpose: Assesses the efficiency of logistics and delivery operations.  
11.	Average Fulfillment Time: Average number of days to fulfill an order.  
o	Purpose: Measures operational efficiency in order processing.   

**Customer and Sales Insights**    

12.	Revenue-Weighted Profitability by Region: Combines profitability and revenue weight for each region.   
o	Purpose: Balances profitability with revenue contribution to identify valuable regions.  
13.	Repeat Purchase Rate: Percentage of customers who placed more than one order.  
o	Purpose: Indicates customer retention and loyalty.  
14.	Customer Churn Rate: Percentage of customers with only one order.   
o	Purpose: Measures customer attrition and helps target retention strategies.  
15.	Time Decay Revenue Trends: Revenue weighted by a time-decay factor to emphasize recent sales.   
o	Purpose: Highlights recent revenue trends over older sales.  
16.	Inventory Risk by Subcategory: Difference between initial stock and sales volume.   
o	Purpose: Identifies overstocked or underperforming product subcategories.  

**Operational and Risk KPIs**  

17.	Profit Leakage: The total revenue lost due to discounts and shipping costs.   
o	Purpose: Quantifies areas where profit margins are reduced.  
18.	Customer Dependency Risk: Percentage of revenue contributed by the top 5% of customers.   
o	Purpose: Highlights over-reliance on a small group of customers.  
19.	Cost-to-Serve Index: The percentage of revenue spent on discounts and shipping by region.  
o	Purpose: Assesses cost efficiency across regions.  
20.	Cross-Sell Opportunity Score: Average number of unique product categories purchased by customers.   
o	Purpose: Identifies potential for cross-selling to existing customers.  
21.	Seasonal Sales Sensitivity: Monthly revenue trends by category.  
o	Purpose: Highlights seasonal patterns to optimize inventory and marketing.
